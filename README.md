# Ecobee Plugin adapted for openluup based on Watou's original Vera plugin.

Plugin will work on UI7 as well though I see no specific reason to not use the Appstore Released version which does not require your own developer's account. 
Note: As of 10/24/2018 no version prior to V2.1 will connect to the ecobee API. Please upgrade to V2.1 or above.

## Release Note: V2.2 (openLuup/UI7)

 - Added services to control mode in scene editor. Thanks rigpapa
 - Changed Icon location to be compatible with FW 7.30. Icons must now be located under /www/cmh/skins/default/icons

## Release Note: V2.11 (openLuup/UI7)

 - Improved connectivity resilience.

## Release Note: V2.1 (openLuup/UI7)

 - Implemented TLS v1.2 to support updates to the ecobee API from 10/23/18

## Release Note: V2.02 (openLuup/UI7)

 - Implemented API Key Retention: If connection is lost, clicking the getpin button even without the API key field will get you a new pin if you have previously been connected.

## Release Note: V2.0 (openLuup/UI7)

 - Split out Implemetation xml logic into L_Ecobee1.lua file
 - Integrated encrypted API file communication into main Lua file
 - Cosmetic refactoring with icons and layout for the main Ecobee device and Housemode device
 - Localized icons to reduce browser network traffic
 - Eliminated use of compressed json decoder
 
## Release Note: V1.8 (UI7/UI5) need to have previously installed from Vera apstore.
